# Pseudo Code Solution

<!-- We have to convert minutes to hour in order to calculate using miles/hour. -->
let hoursTravelled = minutes / 60

<!-- We need to write a function that uses the duration and speed to calculate how many miles we have travelled. -->
function milesTravelled (hoursTravelled, speed) {

}

<!-- We need to round the answer to the nearest mile. -->
math.round(milesTravelled())
